For MacTeX (TeX Live) 2016 and later. A document describing the changes to eps & tiff conversion, etc., using pdflatex. All references to using `convert' have been removed since MacTeX-2014 and later no longer install that software. There is an additional line added to the texmf.cnf file when that method is used instead of `--shell-escape'.
